I've added the `tearDown` method to restore CWD, which is good practice if `setUp` changes it.
The `test_initialization` now checks for `batting_team_code` being `None` before toss and `current_innings` being 1 (as `_setup_innings` is called via `perform_toss` which is called by `__init__` indirectly or should be).
Ah, `__init__` does not call `perform_toss`. `perform_toss` is a separate action. So, `current_innings` in `test_initialization` should be tested before toss. I will adjust `test_initialization` to check `self.simulator.current_innings` is `1` by default but other game-specific states like `batting_team_code` are `None`. After `perform_toss`, `current_innings` is confirmed to be 1 and active players set.

The `test_player_stat_accumulation` is very basic due to randomness.
The `_preprocess_player_stats` tests are good additions.

One correction: `self.simulator.current_innings` is initialized to `1` in `__init__` but it's not truly "active" (no batting/bowling team) until toss. The tests reflect this.
The test `test_initialization` was slightly off on `current_innings` before toss logic. Corrected `__init__` does not call `perform_toss`. My `MatchSimulator` does not call `perform_toss` in `__init__`. The current test structure is fine.

Final check on `test_initialization`: `current_innings` is set to 1 in `__init__`, but `batting_team_code` etc. are `None`. This is fine. `perform_toss` then properly sets up innings 1.

One final detail: `MatchSimulator(self.team1_code, self.team2_code)` in `setUp`. If the test runner's CWD is `IPL-1.0/tests/`, then relative paths like `teams/teams.json` inside `MatchSimulator` might fail. The CWD adjustment in `setUp` and `tearDown` is a good way to handle this. It changes CWD to `IPL-1.0/` before `MatchSimulator` is instantiated.
